# Carbon Emission Prediction

This project aims to predict carbon emissions using machine learning models based on key factors such as fuel consumption, industrial output, transportation statistics, and more. The predictions can help policymakers, researchers, and businesses make informed decisions to reduce environmental impact and work toward sustainability goals.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Predict CO₂ emissions using historical and contextual data.
- Explore and preprocess datasets for model training.
- Apply and evaluate different machine learning models.
- Visualize trends and prediction outputs.
- Promote data-driven solutions for climate action.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses publicly available datasets containing data related to:
- Fuel and energy consumption
- Industrial production
- Vehicle statistics
- Historical CO₂ emission records

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone 
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd carbon-emission-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the notebook or Python script:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📈 Results

The project compares multiple models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) and evaluates them using metrics such as RMSE and R² score. The best-performing model is used for final prediction and visualization.

## 🌱 Future Improvements

* Integrate real-time data streams
* Deploy a web dashboard for live prediction
* Improve feature engineering with geospatial or weather data
